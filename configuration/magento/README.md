# Establishing a connection within Magento

After the connection has been established in Acumatica, the connector must be established in Magento.

## Viewing the Acumatica endpoint URLs in Magento 

Endpoint URLs are visible for a user to determine the destination of data synced from Magento to Acumatica. These endpoints utilize Acumaticaâ€™s API framework to determine the direction of calls made from Magento to Acumatica.

To view these endpoints, navigate to the **Kensium A-M Connector** workspace in Magento and click **Acumatica Endpoint URLs**.

::: tip Notes
It is not advised to modify URLs without the support of an implementation specialist. Endpoint URLs are added by default upon installing the package. They should be modified only if a customization is present or being added.
