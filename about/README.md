# Introduction

The Magento platform is trusted by more than 250,000 businesses, including some of the world's
leading brands. Magento offers flexible, scalable ecommerce solutions designed to help businesses
grow and succeed online.

Acumatica is the only secure, cloud and browser-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution
with such vast capabilities in its Financial Management, Distribution Management, Customer
Management and Project Accounting suites, and is highly configurable and extensible.
Acumatica-Magento Connector seamlessly connects the Acumatica ERP and Magento ecommerce
platforms. All essential storefront data that is stored in the Acumatica system is synchronized with
the website. 

The Magento Connector links your Acumatica back-office solution with Magento, facilitating seamless communication of product, customer, and fulfillment data. When information is entered into one platform (Magento or Acumatica ERP), the two-way sync automatically populates fields in both systems, eliminating the need for duplicate entries.
