# Licensing and Installation

<TOC />

## What type of Licensing is required for the connector to work? 

Licensing is available for the connector on the Acumatica side. 

## Is there an Acumatica add-on (Customization project) that is required to be installed? 

Yes, we will be publishing AMConnector (Acumatica - Magento) customization packages.   

## Does the Acumatica add-on require additional licensing? 

No. After the connector is licensed in Acumatica, there is no additional licensing needed to be applied 

## What is the licensing model? Annual or Perpetual? 

The connector is licensed on an annual basis. 


## What is the cost of the connector? 

Connector costs vary based on the type of installation.  Please contact your sales representative for the pricing. 

## Is the Connector sold directly to the customer by Kensium? 

Kensium customers must purchase the connector from Kensium. Non-Kensium customers can receive the connector from an Acumatica VAR. 

## Is there a trial or development license available? 

Yes, a trial license of the connector is available and not the development license 

## What are the limitations of the trial license? 

All features of the connector are available in a trial license. Data validation is limited to 100 records per day. 

## How do I know that my license is about to expire? 

Email notifications would go on 30, 7, 3, 2, and 1 days before expiration, and these notifications would be sent to the “Admin” email that is configured in the license request screen. 

A notification will also be shown on the Admin section in Magento, when the administrator logs-in. 

At the time of expiration, contact your account manager to arrange a renewal. 

## After the license expires, what would happen? 

Once the license expires, all of the Acumatica-Magento Connector features will be disabled, and only help and license sections will be active and accessible. 

## How can I renew an Annual/Recurring license? 

Please contact our Sales/Account executive. 

## If I send a license request for renewal one month before expiration, would the remaining one-month validity get added to the renewed license? 

Yes, remaining time left on the previous license would be carry forwarded/added to the renewal. 

## Do I need to purchase another license, if I create a new store in the existing website? 

Yes, connector license is based on Magento installation, and the number of stores.  If a new store is being added to a Magento installation, which exceeds the number of licensed stores, a new license needs to be generated for the additional store.
